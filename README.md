Bulldozer Price Prediction

Overview

This project predicts the sale price of bulldozers using historical auction data. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (with multiple algorithms), evaluation, and generating a final prediction file for submission.

Files Included

notebook.ipynb: The well-documented Google Colab notebook containing all code, explanations, and outputs.

test_predictions.csv: The prediction file in the required format (SalesID,SalePrice), generated by the final Random Forest model.

README.md: This summary file describing the approach, files, and instructions.

Approach Summary

1) Data Preprocessing

Loaded and merged the main dataset (TrainAndValid.csv) with machine metadata (Machine_Appendix.csv).

Removed columns with over 75% missing values.

Converted date columns and extracted year, month, and day features.

Handled missing values using median (numerical) and most frequent (categorical) imputers.

One-hot encoded low-cardinality categorical features and ordinal-encoded high-cardinality features (with robust handling for unseen test categories).

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.


2) MOdel traning and validation 

Retrained the Random Forest model on all available labeled data.

Applied the same preprocessing pipeline to the test data.

Generated predictions for the test set and saved them as test_predictions.csv in the required format.
